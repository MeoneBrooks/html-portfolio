<h1>The Best TV Shows According to Meone</h1> 
<h2>My top 3 TV Shows of all-time.</h2>  
<hr />
<h3>Elementary</h3> 
<p>This is a modern take on Sherlock Holme's story. It features Sherlock and his assistant Joan Watson. I love the dynamic between Sherlock and Joan. Although Joan is a female character, her relationship to Sherlock is platonic. 
</p>
<h3>Bones</h3>
<p>The story follows a forenstic anthropologist and writer, Temperence Brennan, nicknamed 'bones' and her FBI partner, Seeley Booth. This crime fighting duo is backed up by the team at the Jeffersonian that consists of M.E., Dr. Camille Soroyan, the bug and slime guy, Dr. Jack Hodgins, and the beautiful IT expert, Angela Montenegro.
</p>
<h3>Timeless</h3>
<p>Timeless is a series about time travelling. Connor Mason is a rich engineer that invented the time travelling tech and unfortunately his time travel machine, the mothership, was stolen by a terrorist, named Garcia Flynn. The government finds out and sends Agent Denise Christopher to investigate. She puts a team together to send on the prototype time machine, the lifeboat, inorder to stop Flynn. The team consists of Rufus Carlile, the pilot, Wyatt Logan, the soldier, and Lucy Preston, the historian.  </p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Meone Brooks — a passionate and curious individual with a love for learning, creating, and solving problems. I’m currently pursuing an Honours degree in Archaeology, where I’ve developed a deep appreciation for research, analysis, and the stories that physical traces of the past can tell us.</p>

<p>My academic journey has equipped me with skills in critical thinking, data interpretation, and project management, especially through my work in archaeozoology and field analysis. Beyond the lecture halls and excavation sites, I enjoy working on creative and analytical projects that connect people with knowledge in engaging ways.</p>

<p>Whether it’s through research, writing, or digital design, I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate. This portfolio is a space to share what I’ve done, what I’m working on, and what I hope to explore next.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
